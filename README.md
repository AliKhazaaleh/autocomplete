A Go-based REST API that provides intelligent autocomplete functionality for various categories including countries, cities, universities, companies, job titles, and skills. The API uses a Trie data structure for efficient search.

## Features

- Fast autocomplete suggestions for multiple categories
- Case-insensitive searching
- RESTful API endpoints
- Built with Echo framework
- Efficient Trie-based search implementation

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Welcome message
- `GET /countries?q={query}` - Get country name suggestions
